# Attendance Tracker
## Inspiration
Attendance is a mandatory requirement for all students, however, it can be challenging to keep track of attendance amidst a busy schedule. Therefore, it would be helpful to have an alert system in place to notify students before they exceed the attendance limit.
## What it does
This tracker will send out an email to the student when he takes the second leave as a reminder that only 1 more left with him on that subject. If he takes further leave, both the student and the corresponding staff receive emails regarding the lack of attendance. 
## How we built it
To build the tracker system, I utilized Python programming language and an xlsx file to store the attendance records of each student, as well as their corresponding email addresses.
## Challenges we ran into
Initially, I encountered difficulties in establishing a connection between the Python code file and the Excel workbook. However, through some effort and perseverance, I was able to successfully establish the connection.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am delighted to have had the opportunity to participate in a hackathon independently, without any hesitation, and to have successfully developed a system.
## What we learned
Python is highly advantageous when it comes to building a wide range of systems, as it provides flexibility and versatility, enabling developers to create virtually any type of system they desire.
## What's next for Attendance Tracker System
It would be possible to enhance the system by integrating it into the academic tracker app used by students.
